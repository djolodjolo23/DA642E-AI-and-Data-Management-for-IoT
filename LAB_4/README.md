# LAB_4 Repository

The **LAB_4** repository is a subrepository of the **DA642E - AI and Data Management for IoT** course. It contains two tasks, one mandatory and one optional.  

Each task is implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`). The remaining files within the subdirectories include datasets and different Python scripts.
