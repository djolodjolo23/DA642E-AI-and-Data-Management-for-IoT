# LAB_3 Repository

The **LAB_3** repository is a subrepository of the **DA642E - AI and Data Management for IoT** course. It contains three tasks, two mandatory and one optional `A3_4`.  

Each task is implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`). The remaining files within the subdirectories include datasets, microcontroller code, and Python scripts for receiving data over serial communication.
