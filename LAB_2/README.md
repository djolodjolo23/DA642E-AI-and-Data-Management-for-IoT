# LAB_2 Repository

The **LAB_2** repository is a subrepository of the **DA642E - AI and Data Management for IoT** course. It contains seven tasks, each organized in its own subdirectory, sequentially named from `A2_1` to `A2_5`.  

Each task is implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`). The remaining files within the subdirectories include datasets, microcontroller code, and Python scripts for receiving data over serial communication.

## Installing Dependencies

For macOS and Linux users, a convenient way to install all dependencies is by using the `install_all_deps.sh` script. This script will create a global virtual environment and install all required dependencies for each task.  

To use it, run the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
chmod +x install_all_deps.sh
source install_all_deps.sh
