# A.0.7: Deal the cards (function and class) Mandatory - 3pts
# In many card games, each player is dealt a specific number of cards after the deck has been shuffled.
# Write a function, deal, which takes the number of hands, the number of cards per hand, and a deck of cards as its
# three parameters. Your function should return a list containing all of the hands that were dealt. Each hand will be
# represented as a list of cards. When dealing with the hands, your function should modify the deck of cards passed
# to it as a parameter, removing each card from the deck as it is added to a playerâ€™s hand. When cards are dealt, it
# is customary to give each player a card before any player receives an additional card. Your function should follow
# this custom when constructing the hands for the players.

# When done with writing the above function, use your solution to A.0.6 to help you construct a main class
# that creates, shuffles, and deals a deck of cards.
