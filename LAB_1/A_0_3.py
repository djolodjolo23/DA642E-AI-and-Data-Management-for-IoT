# A.0.3: Coin Flip - 3 same flips (loop) Mandatory - 1pts

# Create a program that uses Pythonâ€™s random number generator to simulate flipping a coin several times. The simulated
# coin should be fair, meaning that the probability of heads is equal to the probability of tails.

#Each time the program is run, your program should flip simulated coins until either 3 consecutive heads or 3
# consecutive tails occur. Display an H each time the outcome is heads, and a T each time the outcome is tails, with
# all of the outcomes shown on the same line. Then display the number of flips needed to reach 3 consecutive flips
# with the same outcome.

arr = ['head', 'tail']
